# Giftee.io -- Gifting with friends and family made easy

A personal project to develop skills with advanced React concepts, authentication, server-side logic, database management, and general AWS skills.

I was inspired to make this since my family struggles with gift lists every holiday. In the past we tried different services, complex google sheets, and other manual solutions. Giftee makes it easy to:
- create permanent or temporary silo'd wishlists shared with different audiences
- includes optional fields like price, links, descriptions and more!
- ensures anonimity in the gift claiming process
- ensures that no two people get the same gift
